Movie reviews can determine whether the viewer will spend their money at the movie theater.

## Plot 

Rotten Tomatoes certifies what's rotten and fresh for the audience. Rotten Tomatoes also let's the audience post their own reviews.





Joel Meares joined Rotten Tomatoes in Feb 2018.


## Twists 

More people are entering and graduating public high schools.
	- Costs of public school are increasing overtime with no difference in test scores [link](https://www.cato.org/blog/public-school-spending-theres-chart)

College enrollment is 5% lower this semester than the previous year. 

College enrollment peaked in Fall 2010. [link](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372)

## Ending Statement

With more people requiring higher paying jobs, how will student enrollment be affected?


## Research Plan 

I have a couple sources, but I could use more.
	- Look at how different areas are doing
	- Compare cost of school with graduation
	- Look for data on graduate income

I plan on getting more sources online. 

I plan on producing graphs to reflect my conclusion once I find one.
