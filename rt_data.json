Though initially the pair seems to have nothing in common, conversation gradually reveals that both men have a long list of goals they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket, and an unrealized desire to discover what kind of men they really are. But one can't accomplish such lofty objectives from the confines of a hospital bed, so now, in order to live their lives to the absolute fullest, Edward and Carter will have to make a break for it.

Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) is a young American professional who has recently been offered a coveted new job in Japan. Eager to send his older sibling off in style, Rob's younger brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), organize a surprise going-away party to take place the night before Rob boards his Eastern-bound flight. As the party gets underway, Rob's longtime friend and current love interest, Beth (Odette Yustman), shows up with another man as the dejected guest of honor's best-pal Hud (T.J. Miller) encourages partygoer Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) to wish him an on-camera farewell despite the fact that they barely know one another. Moments after Beth storms out following a bitter skirmish with Rob, the entire New York City skyline goes dark. Power is quickly restored, prompting partygoers to turn their attention toward the news, where they learn that a freight tanker has been overturned in New York Harbor. Racing to the rooftop in hopes of getting a better look at the situation, the group is terrified to witness a massive explosion that rains debris across midtown Manhattan, causing mass chaos and unparalleled destruction. But the worst is yet to come, because it soon becomes apparent that this is not the work of a terrorist or an act of war, but a massive creature beyond human comprehension. Now, as the military moves in and the streets of New York City become a virtual war zone, Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud race to rescue Beth and get out of the city before the powers that be unleash the ultimate weapon of mass destruction on one of the most populated cities on the planet. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for violence, terror and disturbing images)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=14", "text": "Science Fiction & Fantasy"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/matt_reeves", "text": "Matt Reeves"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/drew_goddard", "text": "Drew Goddard"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/crew_goodard", "text": "Crew Goodard"}], "date_theaters": "2008-01-15T16:00:00-08:00", "date_disc": "2008-04-21T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 84, "top10gross": 126624750, "top10percentchange": 28.2, "overallgross": 154669517, "overallpercentchange": 18.6, "numreleases": 101, "num1release": "Cloverfield", "weeknum": 3, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2019919361/?ref_=bo_wey_table_58"}, {"year": 2008, "tomato_score": 2, "aud_score": 25, "synopsis": "From the creators of Scary Movie and Date Movie comes this tongue-in-cheek parody of the sword-and-sandal epics, dubbed Meet the Spartans.

For centuries, an ancient truce has kept the na\u00efve citizens of the human race safe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to change, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a tyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in the land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to assemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to wage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's days are numbered. But Hellboy (Perlman) isn't about to stand idly by as the planet is purged by a demonic despot, and with a little help from his team at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, he may just be able to send our otherworldly overlords packing. Of course, Hellboy's pyrokinetic girlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair), is always willing to conjure up an inferno or two when things get desperate, aquatic Abe (Doug Jones) is prepared to dive headlong into any battle, and protoplasmic mystic Johann (voice of Thomas Kretschmann) proves an invaluable companion in times of inter-dimensional conflict. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual realm gear up for an all-out attack on the human plane, the only one capable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by both worlds. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, and some language)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=14", "text": "Science Fiction & Fantasy"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/guillermo_del_toro", "text": "Guillermo del Toro"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/guillermo_del_toro", "text": "Guillermo del Toro"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/mike_mignola_3", "text": "Mike Mignola"}], "date_theaters": "2008-06-27T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2008-11-10T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 120, "top10gross": 139919684, "top10percentchange": -6.7, "overallgross": 151360113, "overallpercentchange": -5.5, "numreleases": 127, "num1release": "Hellboy II: The Golden Army", "weeknum": 28, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl844727809/?ref_=bo_wey_table_29"}, {"year": 2008, "tomato_score": 94, "aud_score": 94, "synopsis": "Christopher Nolan steps back into the director's chair for this sequel to Batman Begins, which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- the dreaded Joker.

It soon becomes apparent that the organization behind the blackmailing of Vesper is more powerful than Bond and M had previously anticipated, and after discovering forensic evidence that links an MI6 traitor to a bank in Haiti, Bond immediately sets out to gather more intelligence. Once in Haiti, a case of mistaken identity leads Bond into the company of the ravishing Camille (Olga Kurylenko), a dangerous beauty with her own vendetta. It's Camille who leads Bond to a ruthless businessman named Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), who is soon revealed to be the mastermind of a powerful but clandestine organization. Greene is conspiring to corner the market on one of the world's most precious natural resources, and in order to make that happen he has forged a deal with an exiled general named Medrano (Joaquin Cosio). By enlisting the aid of his many associates and using his vast resources to force contacts within the CIA and the British government into bending to his will, Greene plans to overthrow the current regime of a Latin American country and hand control over to General Medrano in exchange for a parcel of land that appears barren on the surface, but actually houses a natural resource that will make Greene the most powerful man on the planet. But Bond's mission to uncover the culprit who blackmailed Vesper and prevent Dominic Greene from exerting his will on the entire world won't be easy, because now everyone from the CIA to the terrorists and even M are out to get him. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action, and some sexual content)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/marc_forster", "text": "Marc Forster"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/neal_purvis", "text": "Neal Purvis"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/robert_wade", "text": "Robert Wade"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/paul_haggis", "text": "Paul Haggis"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/marc_forster", "text": "Marc Forster"}], "date_theaters": "2008-11-13T16:00:00-08:00", "date_disc": "2009-03-23T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 105, "top10gross": 134787672, "top10percentchange": 9.2, "overallgross": 148685590, "overallpercentchange": 4.3, "numreleases": 127, "num1release": "Quantum of Solace", "weeknum": 46, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3445261825/?ref_=bo_wey_table_9"}, {"year": 2008, "tomato_score": 49, "aud_score": 73, "synopsis": "When Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) reluctantly moved to the perpetually overcast town of Forks, WA, and set out to carve a niche for herself, she assumed it would be one similar to the low-profile social position she held back in Phoenix.

The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. Despite the fact that Kowalski wants nothing to do with the young troublemaker, he realizes that the quickest way out of the situation is to simply cooperate. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "R (for language throughout, and some violence)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/clint_eastwood", "text": "Clint Eastwood"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/nick_schenk", "text": "Nick Schenk"}], "date_theaters": "2009-01-08T16:00:00-08:00", "date_disc": "2009-06-08T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 130, "top10gross": 121541116, "top10percentchange": -1.4, "overallgross": 146505600, "overallpercentchange": -4.5, "numreleases": 92, "num1release": "Gran Torino", "weeknum": 2, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl240616961/?ref_=bo_wey_table_59"}, {"year": 2009, "tomato_score": 33, "aud_score": 43, "synopsis": "A New Jersey rent-a-cop gets his moment to shine as the holidays approach and Santa's little helpers stage a coup at the local shopping mall in this comedy starring King of Queens' Kevin James.

Instead of submitting a drawing, however, one little girl scribbles a series of seemingly random numbers on her paper before it is buried. Fifty years later, the time capsule is unearthed for a new generation of students to examine. Young Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) is one of those students. The mysterious sequence of numbers falling into his possession, Caleb takes the paper to his father, Professor John Koestler (Cage), for examination. Studying the numbers, Professor Koestler soon discovers that they aren't random at all, but an encoded message containing the precise dates, death tolls, and coordinates of every major disaster since the time capsule was buried. Not only that, but the document also indicates that there will be three more such events, the last of which indicates a doomsday scenario that appears directly tied to Professor Koestler and Caleb. His desperate plea to authorities falling on deaf ears, Professor Koestler realizes that his only hope for preventing more lives from being lost is to take personal action. Though the author of the prophecies is no longer living, Professor Koestler is eventually able to track down her daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), and granddaughter Abby, who reluctantly agree to aid in the investigation.

Vowing revenge, Logan agrees to take part in a dangerous experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called adamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength needed to defeat his powerful brother.

Suspecting that the castle may even harbor an outright threat, Harry finds his investigation into the matter sidelined by Dumbledore's attempts to prepare him for the monumental battle looming ever closer on the horizon. In order to discover the key to Voldemort's defenses, Dumbledore enlists the aid of resourceful yet unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, who may have a clue as to their enemy's Achilles' heel. Meanwhile, teenage hormones cause the students at Hogwarts to lose focus on their true mission. As Harry and Dean Thomas clash for the affections of the lovely Ginny, Romilda Vane attempts to woo Ron away from Lavender Brown with some particularly tasty chocolates. Even Hermione isn't immune from the love bug, though she tries her hardest to suppress her growing jealousy and keep her emotions bottled up.

Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome intruders, a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate, the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man on the planet.

Katie has an interest in the paranormal and believes that malevolent spirits have been following her since childhood, though Micah is not so easily convinced. However, after several nights of loud noises and strange happenings, Micah starts to agree with Katie that some sort of ghost may have followed them to the new home.

Unable to raise the money himself, John persuades the hospital's compassionate cardiac surgeon, Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods), to waive his lofty fee, but is still left with too much of a financial burden to bear.

Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001).

A half-vampire, half-human hybrid, Blade (Snipes) is a merciless vampire hunter bent on destroying the bloodsuckers that feed on humanity. The keys to Blade's success are a serum that allows him to resist the urge for blood and an array of inventive, deadly weapons, both of which were once supplied by his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Since Whistler's death, Blade has relocated to Prague and recruited the pot-smoking slacker Scud (Norman Reedus) to take the place of his father figure, but then he discovers that Whistler's not dead after all: He's been infected with the vampire virus. Reunited with Whistler, Blade is dealt an even bigger surprise: His greatest enemy, vampire leader Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), wants to make peace with him. It seems that the vampires are facing a greater threat than Blade and hope to persuade him to fight the Reapers, a mutated super-race of vampires on a rampage of murder, indiscriminately killing both humans and their fellow bloodsuckers while sucking their victims dry. Blade agrees to a truce and joins the Bloodpack, an elite squad of commandos originally formed to fight Blade himself. Soon, the vampire soldiers discover that the virus responsible for creating their enemies is spreading rapidly and can be traced back to a mysterious \"Patient Zero.\" Blade 2 (2002) co-stars Ron Perlman, Leonor Varela, Donnie Yen, and Matt Schulze. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi", "rating": "R (for strong pervasive violence, language, some drug use and sexual content)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=10", "text": "Horror"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/guillermo_del_toro", "text": "Guillermo del Toro"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/david_goyer", "text": "David S.

Late for a crucial appointment, hotshot lawyer Gavin tosses Doyle a blank check and leaves the scene, while Doyle, whose car is inoperable, is late for a court-appointed custody hearing. A recovering alcoholic, Doyle's tardiness doesn't sit well with the judge, who - sick of waiting for Gipson - grants custody to Doyle's ex-wife in Doyle's absence. The situation worsens when it becomes evident that Doyle has an equally important file belonging to Gavin, which proves that an elderly man gave Banek's firm power-of-attorney over his foundation. So begins an escalating war of words and deeds between the two men.

Working with Fred are: his rich, beautiful girlfriend, Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who has a bad habit of getting kidnapped by villains; Velma (Linda Cardellini), the real brains of the group who pines secretly for Fred; cowardly slacker and dog's best friend Shaggy (Matthew Lillard); and the snack-gobbling pet pooch Scooby. However, after solving its latest case involving a beleaguered toy company owner (Pamela Anderson), the group fractures over Fred's habit of grabbing credit for everyone's hard work, despite the pleas of Shaggy and Scooby. Two years later, they are reunited at Spooky Island, a theme park and teen spring break destination that owner Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) claims is plagued with ghosts. Suspicious as usual of any claims involving the paranormal, the Mystery Inc. clan is soon probing a scheme involving ancient rites, summoned spirits, and brainwashed college students, forcing the group members to resolve their differences and uncover the truth.

Anderton works for \"Precrime,\" a special unit of the police department that arrests murderers before they have committed the actual crime. Precrime bases its work on the visions of three psychics or \"precogs\" whose prophecies of future events are never in error. When Anderton discovers that he has been identified as the future killer of a man he's never met, he is forced to become a fugitive from his own colleagues as he tries to uncover the mystery of the victim-to-be's identity. When he kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the precogs, he begins to formulate a theory about a possible frame-up from within his own department.

When Preston Blake (Harve Presnell), a remarkably wealthy media magnate, dies with neither a wife nor children, the question on the lips of most of his associates is who will inherit the estate. The surprising answer turns out to be Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), a cheerful but half-bright proprietor of a small-town pizzeria, as well as part-time greeting card poet, who was a distant relative of Blake. In order to claim his 40-billion-dollar inheritance, Deeds heads to New York City, where Blake's former associates, Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher) and Cecil Anderson (Erick Avari), introduce him to the city while trying to figure out how to get their hands on his new fortune. Meanwhile, Mac McGrath (Jared Harris), the producer of a sleazy tabloid television show, wants to get the inside scoop on Deeds, and comes up with perfect way to get it: he sends beautiful but unscrupulous reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder) to sweep Deeds off his feet while she's wired for sound. Convincing Deeds that she's from a small town just like himself, Bennett quickly wins his heart, but while his affection is sincere, hers is not. He also displays a curious eagerness to defend her good name with his fists which quickly gets him in trouble. Meanwhile, as Deeds becomes the new laughing stock of New York thanks to Bennett's stories, Deeds decides it's time he did something big with his money, while Cedar and Anderson think they've finally found a way to take control of Deeds' holdings. Mr. Deeds also features supporting performances from John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, and Conchata Ferrell. John McEnroe and Rev. Al Sharpton make cameo appearances as themselves. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for language including sexual references, and some rear nudity)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/steven_brill", "text": "Steven Brill"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tim_herlihy", "text": "Tim Herlihy"}], "date_theaters": "2002-06-27T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2002-10-21T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 96, "top10gross": 125614968, "top10percentchange": -14.0, "overallgross": 142406572, "overallpercentchange": -12.3, "numreleases": 101, "num1release": "Mr. Deeds", "weeknum": 26, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2540013057/?ref_=bo_wey_table_31"}, {"year": 2002, "tomato_score": 39, "aud_score": 45, "synopsis": "Otherworldly villains are on the loose again, and it's up to Earth's interstellar police force to bring them to justice in this sequel to the sci-fi comedy blockbuster Men in Black.

Despite a shady past involving drugs and the juvenile justice system, Ben Cronin (Bradford) seems to have it all: a loving mother, a devoted girlfriend (Shiri Appleby), and a shot at a college scholarship in California. But the same week that athletic scouts will be deciding his future, Ben finds himself embroiled in a flirtation with Madison Bell (Christensen), a bewitching transfer student who seduces him into supposedly strings-free sex during an impromptu swim lesson after hours in the school pool. When Ben takes Madison at her word and goes about his business as if nothing had happened, she insinuates herself into his life with sinister glee. Showing up at Ben's house, befriending his girlfriend, and sending him naked pictures -- none of her strategies wins his heart. So Madison turns to other, more devious forms of courtship. Soon, Ben finds himself kicked off the swim team for supposed steroid use, suspected of murdering a rival (Clayne Crawford), and rejected by his girlfriend for his sexual indiscretions. Eventually, though, he receives help in uncovering the genesis of Madison's uncanny fixation from an unexpected source. Originally titled \"Swimfan85\" (after Madison's Internet screen name), the retitled Swimfan hit the top spot at the back-to-school box office when it was released September 6, 2002. Dan Hedaya co-stars as Ben's stern but loving mentor, Coach Simkins. Actor-turned-director John Polson previously helmed Siam Sunset. ~ Brian J.

However, it isn't long before Harry and company discover something is amiss at Hogwarts: Students are petrified like statues, threats are written in blood on the walls, and a deadly monster is on the loose.

Marisa works as a housekeeper at the exclusive Beresford Hotel in Manhattan, where her boss Paula Burns (Frances Conroy) and chief butler Lionel Bloch (Bob Hoskins) urge Marisa and her best friend and fellow maid Stephanie (Marissa Matrone) to be as efficient and inconspicuous as possible. One day, while cleaning the room of noted socialite Caroline Lane (Natasha Richardson), Stephanie spies a beautiful designer gown and dares Marisa to try it on; against her better judgment, she does, and while all dolled up, she bumps into Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a wealthy and well-bred bachelor who is running for the Senate. Immediately charmed, Chris asks Marisa to join him for a walk in Central Park, assuming she's the blue-blooded Caroline. Marisa manages to join Chris for the afternoon, with Ty in tow, and Chris finds himself quite taken with Marisa's beauty and down-to-earth personality, as well as Ty's precocious interest in politics. Chris later calls Caroline's room to set up a lunch date, but soon discovers the stuffy Ms. Lane is not the woman he met before. Marisa is also attracted to Chris, but while her friends encourage her to pursue a romance, Veronica believes her daughter is asking for trouble by trying to win a man so far out of her social strata.

Jackson (\"The Hateful Eight,\" \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\"), Oscar winner Brie Larson (\"Room,\" \"Trainwreck\"), John Goodman (\"Transformers: Age of Extinction,\" \"Argo\") and John C. Reilly (\"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" \"Step Brothers\"). The international ensemble cast also includes Tian Jing (\"Police Story: Lockdown\"), Corey Hawkins (\"Straight Outta Compton\"), Jason Mitchell (\"Straight Outta Compton\"), John Ortiz (\"Steve Jobs\"), Thomas Mann (\"Beautiful Creatures\"), Shea Whigham (\"The Wolf of Wall Street\"), Toby Kebbell (\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\") and Eugene Cordero (\"The Kings of Summer\"). Vogt-Roberts is directing the film from a screenplay by Max Borenstein, John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Derek Connolly. \"Kong: Skull Island\" is produced by Legendary's Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni with Mary Parent. The executive producers are Eric McLeod and Alex Garcia. The creative behind-the-scenes team includes director of photography Larry Fong (\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\"), production designer Stefan Dechant (supervising art director \"True Grit,\" \"Avatar\"), editor Christian Wagner (the \"Fast & Furious\" films), and costume designer Mary Vogt (the \"Men in Black\" films). The team also includes Oscar-winning makeup supervisor Bill Corso (\"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\") and supervising stunt coordinator George Cottle (\"Interstellar,\" \"The Dark Knight Rises\"). The legendary Kong is being brought to life at a whole new scale by Industrial Light & Magic, with two-time Oscar winner Stephen Rosenbaum (\"Avatar,\" \"Forrest Gump\") serving as visual effects supervisor. To fully immerse audiences in the mysterious Skull Island, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and his cast and filmmaking team are filming across three continents over six months, capturing its primordial landscapes on Oahu, Hawaii - where filming commenced on October 2015 - on Australia's Gold Coast, and finally in Vietnam, where filming will take place across multiple locations, some of which have never before been seen on film. Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, \"Kong: Skull Island.\" The film will be released worldwide in 2D, 3D in select theatres, and IMAX beginning March 10, 2017, from Warner Bros.

However, even after the knot is tied, Sarah's former beau, Peter Prentiss (Christian Kane), is dead set upon breaking up the happy couple, though as it turns out, a seemingly endless stream of bad luck and post-marital jitters may do the job for him.

Stu steps into a phone booth on a busy New York street to make a call to Pamela without Kelly being the wiser, but as soon as Stu hangs up, the phone begins to ring. Curious, Stu picks it up -- and a stranger on the other end (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) informs him that if he hangs up the phone, he'll be shot. The red dot of an infrared rifle scope convinces Stu that the caller means business, and when another man tries to make his way into the booth, he's shot mere inches from Stu, calling the attention of the police. Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) naturally assumes that Stu was the killer, as Stu struggles to find a way to convince the police of what's happening before more lives are lost, without leaving the booth and putting his own life on the line.

Neo and Trinity's work together has been complicated by the fact the two are involved in a serious romantic relationship. Upon their arrival in Zion, Morpheus locks horns with rival Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix) and encounters his old flame Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has returned with some surprises for Neo, most notably the ability to replicate himself as many times as he pleases. Neo makes his way to The Oracle (Gloria Foster), who informs him that if he wishes to save humankind, he must unlock \"The Source,\" which means having to release The Key Maker (Randall Duk Kim) from the clutches of Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). While Merovingian refuses to cooperate, his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci), angry at her husband's dalliances with other women, offers to help, but only in exchange for a taste of Neo's affections. With The Keymaker in tow, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are chased by Merovingian's henchmen: a pair of deadly albino twins (Neil Rayment and Adrian Rayment).

Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself (Morgan Freeman) appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against; God bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum -- he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void.

Then Bruce accidentally gets hit by an experimental ray and grows into a huge beast, destroying the lab in the process. A creepy janitor who claims to be his real father, Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte), starts to secretly use the experimental ray on himself. He creates some mutant dogs and sends them after Bruce's lab mate and ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). After Bruce saves her life in the form of the Hulk, she lets her distant father, General Ross (Sam Elliott), take him to an abandoned army base in the desert. However, Glenn Talbot takes over the operation and wants to patent the creature's superpowers for his own profit, so he holds Bruce unconscious in an isolation tank. When provoked, Bruce turns into the Hulk and makes a break for San Francisco, leading to a desert chase sequence involving military aircraft, tanks, and bombs.

Coaxed by surviving teenagers Will (Jason Ritter), Lori (Monica Keena), and Kia (Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland), Jason and Freddy descend upon Crystal Lake for a mano a mano battle royal.

What Michael doesn't know is he has witnessed a skirmish between two deadly underground communities, unknown to the mortal world, who are battling for supremacy -- the Death Dealers, a tribe of vampires, and the Lycans, a band of werewolves. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a leading member of the Death Dealers who hears through the grapevine that the Lycans have plans to capture the aspiring doctor who witnessed their battle. Certain something is in the air, Selene begins following Michael around the city, and she finds herself growing emotionally attached to him. As Selene becomes more attracted to Michael, she becomes more convinced that the Lycans are planning a major attack against the Death Dealers, although vampire kingpin Kraven (Shane Brolly) is certain she's crediting the Lycans with more intelligence than they can muster. As Selene shadows Michael, she finds herself wanting to protect him, but her longing becomes a handicap when he's attacked by Lucian (Michael Sheen), the leader of the werewolf community, and the man she wants to save has now become a sworn enemy.

It turns out that there is a reason why Stine is so strange... he is a prisoner of his own imagination - the monsters that his books made famous are real, and Stine protects his readers by keeping them locked up in their books.

But on Christmas Eve, Chuck proposes marriage to Kelly right before embarking on a large assignment.

Finding solace only in a volleyball that he befriends, Chuck must now learn to endure the emotional and physical stress of his new life, unsure of when he may return to the civilization he knew before.

Stanley has been paroled from prison after serving a lengthy sentence for penetrating the FBI's cyber-surveillance operations. Issued a restraining order that keeps him away from computers and living penniless in a trailer park, Stanley wants only to be reunited with his daughter Holly, who's in the custody of his ex-wife, now remarried to a pornographer. Gabriel and his partner Ginger (Halle Berry) offer Stanley the chance to get his child back in exchange for his help, but the hacker soon realizes he's a pawn in a larger operation than the high-tech bank heist he thought he was perpetrating.

In 1888, a ruthless and cold-blooded killer begins hunting prostitutes in East London, and while the murderer's work is savage, the mutilation of his victims suggests the fiend has an extensive medical background. Amidst a background of political unrest and barely contained scandal among the royal family, the murderer's grisly exploits shock and frighten all of England, and one of Scotland Yard's top inspectors, Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), is put on the case, along with his partner, Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane). Abberline, depending on one's viewpoint, is either blessed or cursed with second sight, and while he blurs his ability to see future events with opium and other drugs, he still has an uncanny ability to ferret out dangerous criminals, which is put to the test as he and Godley search for the Ripper. As Abberline and Godley investigate the neighborhood where the crimes occur, they become acquainted with the prostitutes and street people who were friends and compatriots of the victims, and Abberline finds himself falling in love with Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a beautiful Irish streetwalker. As Abberline tries to identify the killer before Mary Kelly can become the next victim, he and Godley have to contend with Sir Charles Warren (Ian Richardson), their superior who is keen to pin the murders on a culprit who isn't British, and Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a respected physician who has his own ideas about the murders and the benefits of psychosurgery.

The similarities to the original end there, as Ocean conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Between the two of them, they recruit nine other men, each with his own criminal specialty, to assist in the mission: moneyman Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), card dealer Frank (Bernie Mac), pickpocket Linus (Matt Damon), aging con artist Saul (Carl Reiner), British explosives pro Basher (Don Cheadle), techie Dell (Eddie Jemison), rude-boy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan), and professional acrobat Yen (Shaobo Qin). What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess (Julia Roberts).

Tom Cruise stars as David Ames, a womanizing playboy who finds romantic redemption when he falls in love with his best friend's girlfriend Sofia (Penelope Cruz, reprising her role from the original film). Before that relationship can begin, however, David is coaxed into a car driven by an ex-lover, Julie (Cameron Diaz), who turns out to be suicidal. Driving her car off a bridge, Julie kills herself and horribly disfigures David. Reconstructive surgery and the loving support of Sofia seem to reverse David's luck, but eerie incidents are soon making him question the reality of his existence and his control over his life, even while he is suspected of complicity in Julie's death. Vanilla Sky (2001) bears the expected Crowe trademark of an obsession with recent pop culture and particularly rock music, a more important element of the remake than the original film. That project's writer/director, Alejandro Amenabar, crafted his own supernatural hit the same year with The Others (2001), starring Nicole Kidman, the soon-to-be-ex-wife of Cruise. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi", "rating": "R (for sexuality and strong language)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=14", "text": "Science Fiction & Fantasy"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/cameron_crowe", "text": "Cameron Crowe"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/alejandro_amenabar", "text": "Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/mateo_gil", "text": "Mateo Gil"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/cameron_crowe", "text": "Cameron Crowe"}], "date_theaters": "2001-12-13T16:00:00-08:00", "date_disc": "2002-05-20T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 136, "top10gross": 86788851, "top10percentchange": 7.1, "overallgross": 92818428, "overallpercentchange": 6.2, "numreleases": 63, "num1release": "Vanilla Sky", "weeknum": 50, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl209290753/?ref_=bo_wey_table_5"}, {"year": 2001, "tomato_score": 91, "aud_score": 95, "synopsis": "Assisted by a Fellowship of heroes, Frodo Baggins plunges into a perilous trek to take the mystical One Ring to Mount Doom so that it and its magical powers can be destroyed and never possessed by evil Lord Sauron.

The Eye's latest assignment is a surveillance project; the son of a well-known politician has been spending a great deal of money on someone, and they would like to know who and why. A little sleuthing reveals that the mysterious person taking the cash is a woman named Joanna (Ashley Judd), but the trail gets much stickier when the Eye witnesses Joanna pulling a knife and killing the politician's son. Normally, he'd take the shortcut to putting her behind bars, but some time ago he lost contact with his daughter when his wife left him; Joanna reminds the Eye of his daughter, and he's too fascinated with her to bring her to justice. The Eye now follows Joanna obsessively, and discovers that she's also involved with a blind man (Patrick Bergin) and has a history of emotional instability from being abandoned by her father at a young age.

But his retirement plans are interrupted when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) gets in trouble with a dangerous crime boss.

John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson), the namesake nephew of the legendary private eye (Richard Roundtree), is a street-smart police detective who with his partner Carmen Velez (Vanessa L. Williams) has been assigned to a racially motivated murder case, in which a black college student was killed in front of a restaurant by Walter Williams Jr. (Christian Bale), the sociopathic son of a New York construction tycoon, who then fled the country rather than face prosecution. Diane Palmieri (Toni Collette), a waitress on a smoke break, saw the murder, but she doesn't want to talk to the police. Two years later, Walter is forced to return to New York, but without Diane's testimony, the city doesn't have much of a case. Soon, Shaft, Walter Junior, and Walter Senior's goons are all looking for Diane, with Junior enlisting the help of Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a small-time drug dealer who will do anything to move into the big leagues. Shaft and Carmen find Diane, but discover that she had a good reason for being on the lam for the past two years. Amidst all this activity, John gets frequent advice from his uncle, with whom he ponders the idea of quitting the force and opening a detective agency. Shaft was directed by John Singleton, from a screenplay by Singleton, Richard Price, and Shane Salerno. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "rating": "R (for strong violence and language)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/john_singleton", "text": "John Singleton"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/john_singleton", "text": "John Singleton"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/richard_price", "text": "Richard Price"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/shane_salerno", "text": "Shane Salerno"}], "date_theaters": "2000-06-15T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2000-12-11T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 98, "top10gross": 94155016, "top10percentchange": 4.1, "overallgross": 105362443, "overallpercentchange": 6.8, "numreleases": 60, "num1release": "Shaft", "weeknum": 24, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2322499073/?ref_=bo_wey_table_36"}, {"year": 2000, "tomato_score": 47, "aud_score": 57, "synopsis": "Six years after Dumb and Dumber, Jim Carrey reunited with Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly for this anarchic comedy with a hint of romance.

After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis. When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown that could spell the end of Kick-Ass once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "R (for strong brutal violence throughout, pervasive language, sexual content, nudity and some drug use -- some involving children)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/matthew_vaughn", "text": "Matthew Vaughn"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/1179482-jane_goldman", "text": "Jane Goldman"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/matthew_vaughn", "text": "Matthew Vaughn"}], "date_theaters": "2010-04-15T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2010-08-02T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 117, "top10gross": 108077823, "top10percentchange": -8.1, "overallgross": 120177056, "overallpercentchange": -5.8, "numreleases": 117, "num1release": "Kick-Ass", "weeknum": 16, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl291276289/?ref_=bo_wey_table_44"}, {"year": 2010, "tomato_score": 99, "aud_score": 91, "synopsis": "The son of a Viking chief must capture a dragon in order to mark his passage into manhood and prove his worthiness to the tribe in directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois' adaptation of Cressida Cowell's popular children's book.

Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth's satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what's more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG (for rude humor and mild action)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=2", "text": "Animation"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=11", "text": "Kids & Family"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/pierre-coffin", "text": "Pierre Coffin"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/chris-renaud", "text": "Chris Renaud"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ken_daurio", "text": "Ken Daurio"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/cinco_paul", "text": "Cinco Paul"}], "date_theaters": "2010-07-08T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2010-12-13T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 95, "top10gross": 182442390, "top10percentchange": 1.9, "overallgross": 191704186, "overallpercentchange": 1.9, "numreleases": 110, "num1release": "Despicable Me", "weeknum": 28, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2018477569/?ref_=bo_wey_table_30"}, {"year": 2010, "tomato_score": 87, "aud_score": 91, "synopsis": "Visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Dark Knight) writes and directs this psychological sci-fi action film about a thief who possesses the power to enter into the dreams of others.

The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "R (for strong violence, pervasive language, some sexuality and drug use)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=18", "text": "Romance"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ben_affleck", "text": "Ben Affleck"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/peter_craig", "text": "Peter Craig"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ben_affleck", "text": "Ben Affleck"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/aaron_stockard", "text": "Aaron Stockard"}], "date_theaters": "2010-09-16T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2010-12-16T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 151, "top10gross": 84334484, "top10percentchange": 36.7, "overallgross": 100674305, "overallpercentchange": 22.8, "numreleases": 135, "num1release": "The Town", "weeknum": 38, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1685554689/?ref_=bo_wey_table_19"}, {"year": 2010, "tomato_score": 55, "aud_score": 44, "synopsis": "Ambitious young investment banker Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf) discovers that greed is still the name of the game when he forges a fragile alliance with onetime Wall Street hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) shortly after Gekko is released from prison. Having served eight years for securities fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, Gekko emerges from prison to find that his daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), prefers to remain estranged, and that his former Wall Street cohorts are still raking in the cash. Flash-forward to 2008, and Winnie is dating a proprietary trader named Jake Moore (LaBeouf), who expresses a passion for green energy while working for his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), of Keller Zabel Investments. Despite heading up one of the most prominent investment firms in the country, Louis Zabel is forced to personally fight for the future of Keller Zabel before the Federal Reserve after the company's stock takes a hit due to persistent rumors that it's being dragged down by debt. Denied a bailout from the government, Keller Zabel soon falls victim to a hostile takeover lead by powerful investment bank partner Bretton James (Josh Brolin), of Churchill Schwartz. His job on the line and his mentor out of the picture, Jake discovers that Gordon Gekko is out promoting his new book \"Is Greed Good?\" and decides to attend a lecture being given by the author at Fordham University. According to Gekko, greed is now sanctioned by the government, and the U.S. economy is on the verge of collapse as a direct result of leveraged debt and wild conjecture. When Jake goes behind Winnie's back to try and repair her relationship with her father, Gekko reveals his compelling theories on the likely reasons for Zabel's downfall. Later, as Jake begins plotting to avenge his mentor, Gekko starts to reveal his true colors. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for brief strong language and thematic elements)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/oliver_stone", "text": "Oliver Stone"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/allan_loeb", "text": "Allan Loeb"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/stephen_schiff", "text": "Stephen Schiff"}], "date_theaters": "2010-09-23T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2010-12-20T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 133, "top10gross": 88901910, "top10percentchange": 5.4, "overallgross": 100709968, "overallpercentchange": 0.1, "numreleases": 138, "num1release": "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps", "weeknum": 39, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3363407361/?ref_=bo_wey_table_18"}, {"year": 2010, "tomato_score": 96, "aud_score": 86, "synopsis": "\"The Social Network\" explores the moment at which Facebook, the most revolutionary social phenomena of the new century, was invented -- through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception.

However, the demonic creature is captured by American forces, and put in the care of Professor Broom (John Hurt), the founder of a top-secret organization called the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Under Broom's tutelage, the creature develops empathy and a desire to do good while his physical powers and paranormal talents are honed to a fine point.

When her family relocates to the United States, Cady finds herself attending a high school in suburban Illinois, where she gets a crash course in the various sub-strata of the student body: the jocks, the cheerleaders, the stoners, the \"cool\" kids, and so on. Much to her surprise, Cady finds herself embraced by a clique of rich and popular girls known to outsiders as \"the Plastics,\" led by Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). While Cady is grateful for her new friends, it doesn't take long for her to realize how manipulative they can be, and she soon discovers she's violated an unwritten law when she goes out on a date with Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), who is charming, good looking...and Regina's former boyfriend.

Planned for years, but plagued by problems such as the death of director John Frankenheimer (before production had even begun) and the exit of star Liam Neeson, the fourth installment of the Exorcist saga finally got off the ground with Paul Schrader (Affliction, Auto Focus) behind the camera and Skarsg\u00e5rd filling the shoes left empty by Neeson. But the pitfalls didn't stop there, as Warner Bros. was disappointed with the approach taken by Schrader after seeing his finished cut, and hired an uncredited Renny Harlin to helm six weeks of reshoots.", "rating": "R (for strong violence and gore, disturbing images and rituals, and language including sexual dialogue)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=10", "text": "Horror"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/renny_harlin", "text": "Renny Harlin"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/alexi_hawley", "text": "Alexi Hawley"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/renny_harlin", "text": "Renny Harlin"}], "date_theaters": "2004-08-19T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2005-10-24T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 114, "top10gross": 96455296, "top10percentchange": -19.5, "overallgross": 119408573, "overallpercentchange": -13.2, "numreleases": 129, "num1release": "Exorcist: The Beginning", "weeknum": 34, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1515226625/?ref_=bo_wey_table_24"}, {"year": 2004, "tomato_score": 95, "aud_score": 87, "synopsis": "Hero is two-time Academy Award nominee Zhang Yimou's directorial attempt at exploring the concept of a Chinese hero.

After robbing a cool $160 million from the Bellaggio Hotel Casino and winning back his former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), from Bellagio owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is living quietly on the lam in Connecticut when he's unexpectedly approached by Benedict. It seems Benedict has tracked down Danny and the ten men who helped him pull off the seemingly impossible robbery, and Benedict offers them a proposal -- if they can repay the $160 million in two weeks, he won't have them killed. As it turns out, both Danny and his best friend, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), haven't been doing so well in terms of money management and could use some cash, so they set out to plan a robbery to recover the loot, with the same crew helping out -- Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner), Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison), Yen (Shaobo Qin), Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck), and his brother Turk (Scott Caan). Danny and Rusty discover that an incredibly rare Faberg\u00e9 egg is being displayed at a museum in Rome which would fetch the price they need, but they soon discover a notorious cat burglar, Fran\u00e7ois Toulour (Vincent Cassel), is also after the egg, and it turns into a race to see who can claim it first. Adding to the intrigue is Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman Rusty used to be involved with who is now a top agent with Interpol and is after both Toulour and Ocean's crew. Shot on location in both the United States and Europe, Ocean's Twelve was, like its precursor, directed by the stylish Steven Soderbergh, who also photographed the picture under his nom de lens, Peter Andrews. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for language)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/steven_soderbergh", "text": "Steven Soderbergh"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/george_nolfi", "text": "George Nolfi"}], "date_theaters": "2004-12-09T16:00:00-08:00", "date_disc": "2005-04-11T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 125, "top10gross": 98593405, "top10percentchange": 30.4, "overallgross": 106966751, "overallpercentchange": 22.7, "numreleases": 125, "num1release": "Ocean's Twelve", "weeknum": 50, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl426149377/?ref_=bo_wey_table_4"}, {"year": 2004, "tomato_score": 72, "aud_score": 63, "synopsis": "The best-selling series of subversive children's books from author Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) come to the screen in this black comedy for the whole family (and how often do you get to see one of those?).

Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) was once a star player on the Richmond High School basketball team in Richmond, CA, and years later, after establishing himself in publishing and marketing, he returns to the school and to the team as the new basketball coach. Carter quickly sees that his work is cut out for him -- the team is having an awful season, and their fights off the court are more decisive than their play on the court. While Carter wants to make the Richmond cagers into a winning team, he also wants a lot more -- to teach the boys to respect themselves and one another, and that they must excel in the classroom as well as in the gymnasium. Under Carter's guidance, the team turns their losing season around, with the state title a genuine possibility. However, when Carter learns that a number of his players have let their grade point averages slip below 2.3, as mandated in a contract he entered into with the students, he decides to lock the team out of the gym and send them into study hall until their marks improve. Carter's plan quickly becomes a subject of controversy among parents and team boosters, and their objections are soon picked up by the local news media, many of whom are not sympathetic to Carter's belief that his players must have goals beyond college ball or the NBA. Coach Carter also features Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez as members of the team, and R&B diva Ashanti in her film debut as the girlfriend of one of Carter's players. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for violence, sexual content, language, teen partying and some drug material)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/thomas_carter_ii", "text": "Thomas Carter"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/mark_schwahn", "text": "Mark Schwahn"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/john_gatins", "text": "John Gatins"}], "date_theaters": "2005-01-13T16:00:00-08:00", "date_disc": "2005-06-20T17:00:00-07:00", "runtime": 136, "top10gross": 112075179, "top10percentchange": 20.0, "overallgross": 138088011, "overallpercentchange": 16.0, "numreleases": 84, "num1release": "Coach Carter", "weeknum": 2, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2118813185/?ref_=bo_wey_table_61"}, {"year": 2005, "tomato_score": 12, "aud_score": 45, "synopsis": "Rapper and actor Ice Cube shows off his softer side in this family-friendly comedy.

He's got a decent job and is moving fast in his relationship with his girlfriend Jessica. But an intense, paralyzing fear that has been terrifying him since childhood is tearing him apart. When Tim was eight, each night his dad would put him to sleep with a bedtime story. Until that one fateful night. As Tim watched from his bed, his father was violently sucked into the closet, and was never seen or heard from again. Tim is terrified that the Boogeyman will return and take him as he has taken so many before. Until now he has coped by eliminating opportunities for the Boogeyman to get to him. He has removed every dark corner in his apartment; there are no closets, and his bed is on the floor so the evil force has nowhere to hide. When Tim is forced to move outside his comfort zone on a Thanksgiving trip to Jessica's parents, he leaves this protected world. After a disturbing dream about his estranged mother, Tim awakens in a cold sweat. His cell phone rings. His mother has died. After the funeral, Tim visits the children's psychiatric hospital where he spent many years after the disappearance of his father. His former counselor reiterates what she has known all along--that in order to get over his fears, he must spend a night alone in the old house and confront things head on. Tim tries to relax and enjoy a reunion with his childhood best friend, Kate, but as Tim relives the past, his crippling fear returns. Tim turns to the only person who shares his fear, Franny, a precocious and mysterious young girl who first appeared at his mother's funeral. She is the only one who sees what he sees--and Tim draws on Franny's courage and advice to face the Boogeyman.

There's the street thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), whose desperate quest to find the killer of a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) will lead him to the foulest edges of town. Inhabiting many of those areas is Dwight (Clive Owen), a photographer in league with the sordid ladies of Sin City, headed by Gail (Rosario Dawson), who opens up a mess of trouble after tangling with a corrupt cop by the name of Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Finally, there's Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop with a heart problem who's hell-bent on protecting a stripper named Nancy (Jessica Alba). Featuring a who's who supporting cast that includes Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, and Nick Stahl, Sin City promises to be one of the most direct translations from page to screen of a comic series, with shots and dialogue adapted straight from the original comic's panels.

Kevin also has a famous mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda), who has enjoyed a long and successful career as a news broadcaster. When Kevin and Charlie fall head over heels for one another, he opts to propose marriage to her as he's introducing Charlie to Viola over lunch. However, as far as Viola is concerned, this could not come at a worse time -- Viola has just been fired from the anchor desk, and regards her son as the only anchor left in her life. Not willing to share Kevin with anyone, Viola sets out to sabotage his relationship with Charlie in any way she can, often with the wary assistance of her secretary Ruby (Wanda Sykes). But once Charlie gets wind of Viola's schemes, she decides two can play this game.

When William Cleary (Christopher Walken), the nation's Secretary of the Treasury and a possible candidate for the Presidency, announces his daughter is to wed, the nuptials are billed as the social event of the year, and Jeremy and John decide they must attend the reception. However, John makes the mistake of falling head over heels for Claire (Rachel McAdams), the bride's sister, while Jeremy attracts the attentions of a woman he'd prefer not to be involved with, and soon their romantic peccadilloes get them in very hot water. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "rating": "R (for sexual content/nudity and language)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=18", "text": "Romance"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/david-dobkin", "text": "David Dobkin"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/steve_faber", "text": "Steve Faber"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/bob_fisher", "text": "Bob Fisher"}], "date_theaters": "2005-07-14T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2006-01-02T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 120, "top10gross": 105645982, "top10percentchange": -14.8, "overallgross": 123665915, "overallpercentchange": -12.0, "numreleases": 128, "num1release": "Wedding Crashers", "weeknum": 30, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1282967041/?ref_=bo_wey_table_29"}, {"year": 2005, "tomato_score": 75, "aud_score": 75, "synopsis": "The General Lee is back and so are the Duke boys in this big-screen adaptation of the hit TV series, brought to you by Jay Chandrasekhar of the Broken Lizard comedy troupe.

When their mother is killed during a robbery at a grocery store, the four brothers come together for the funeral, but when they don't get straight answers about what happened to her, they begin looking into the crime themselves. The deeper they dig into the case, the more the brothers begin to suspect that the shooting wasn't an accident, and that powerful and unexpected forces were involved.

Believing foul play may have overtaken Olduvai's crew, the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, a team of specially trained military personnel, are deployed to investigate the situation and, if necessary, eliminate the invaders. But Sarge (Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock) and Reaper (Karl Urban), leaders of the RRTS team, soon discover the situation is far more grim than they could have imagined. An experiment on Olduvai has very literally opened a portal to Hades, and a variety of savage and demonic creatures have overtaken the colony. Now the RRTS must seal off Olduvai, close off any access to Earth, and exterminate the satanic beasts before they can kill again.

As it happens, Jigsaw is eager to be put behind bars in order to throw the authorities off his trail as he once again punishes people who in his eyes have transgressed the boundaries of acceptable moral behavior. But instead of trapping two people in a filthy dungeon where they must engage in a terrible contest in order to win their freedom, eight people have been locked away by Jigsaw, and they must torture their bodies and minds to achieve the terrible justice Jigsaw seeks.

Inspired by true events, the film follows seminary student Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue), who is sent to study exorcism at the Vatican in spite of his own doubts about the controversial practice and even his own faith. Wearing his deep skepticism like armor, Michael challenges his superiors to look to psychiatry, rather than demons, in treating the possessed. Only when he's sent to apprentice with the unorthodox Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins)--a legendary priest who has performed thousands of exorcisms--does Michael's armor begin to fall. As he is drawn into a troubling case that seems to transcend even Father Lucas's skill, he begins to glimpse a phenomenon science can't explain or control...and an evil so violent and terrifying that it forces him to question everything he believes.

It will take the expertise of a dedicated marine biologist, the ingenuity of a brilliant prosthetics doctor, and the unwavering devotion of a young boy to bring about a groundbreaking miracle-a miracle that might not only save Winter but could also help scores of people around the world. -- (C) Warner Bros", "rating": "PG (for some mild thematic elements)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=11", "text": "Kids & Family"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/charles_martin_smith", "text": "Charles Martin Smith"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/noam_dromi", "text": "Noam Dromi"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/karen_janszen", "text": "Karen Janszen"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/charles_martin_smith", "text": "Charles Martin Smith"}], "date_theaters": "2011-09-22T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2011-12-19T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 113, "top10gross": 83299660, "top10percentchange": -19.5, "overallgross": 99307078, "overallpercentchange": -15.9, "numreleases": 127, "num1release": "Dolphin Tale", "weeknum": 39, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl810452481/?ref_=bo_wey_table_19"}, {"year": 2011, "tomato_score": 60, "aud_score": 73, "synopsis": "A gritty, white-knuckle, action ride set in the near-future where the sport of boxing has gone high-tech, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring.

But, he has no idea just how literally gargantuan and hairy a challenge he will face when he grudgingly accepts the supposedly menial graveyard shift as a security guard at the Natural History Museum. On his very first night on the job, Larry is handed an over-sized flashlight and a dog-eared instruction manual, then left all alone in the eerily quiet, cavernous museum. At least, he thinks he's alone. But wait, what's that noise? To his utter astonishment and disbelief, Larry watches in shock and awe as, one by one, the primeval beasts and storied icons that surround him stir magically to life--and total havoc ensues. Now, as Tyrannosaurus Rex and Attila The Hun carve a swath of destruction through the marble corridors, and lions and monkeys prowl the fragile exhibits, Larry is at a loss as to how to get the museum back under control.

While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG-13 (for brief sensuality)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=9", "text": "Drama"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/steven_soderbergh", "text": "Steven Soderbergh"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/brian_koppelman", "text": "Brian Koppelman"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/david_levien", "text": "David Levien"}], "date_theaters": "2007-06-07T17:00:00-07:00", "date_disc": "2007-11-12T16:00:00-08:00", "runtime": 122, "top10gross": 129422051, "top10percentchange": 1.5, "overallgross": 135804030, "overallpercentchange": 0.8, "numreleases": 128, "num1release": "Ocean's Thirteen", "weeknum": 23, "num1link": "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl442926593/?ref_=bo_wey_table_36"}, {"year": 2007, "tomato_score": 37, "aud_score": 51, "synopsis": "The enigmatic, intergalactic herald, The Silver Surfer, comes to Earth to prepare it for destruction.

All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership.

A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop.

In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) is an FBI agent handling what seems like a routine assignment -- serving as bodyguard for Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips), a Hawaiian surfer dude who is flying to California to testify in a high-profile criminal trial after witnessing mobster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) murdering one of his underlings. However, Flynn's job gets a lot more challenging when he discovers Kim's associates don't want Jones to talk, and have devised a unique way to ensure his silence. A cache of highly dangerous poisonous snakes has been hidden on board the jet, and is released using a timed mechanism once the flight is well underway. The snakes quickly attack several members of the flight crew and are eagerly eying the passengers when Flynn decides its time to get medieval on the reptiles. Also starring Rachel Blanchard, Benjamin McKenzie, and Mark Houghton, Snakes on a Plane was produced under the title of Pacific Air Flight 121, but in several interviews Samuel L. Jackson expressed his enthusiasm for the script's original title, Snakes on a Plane, and the high-concept moniker quickly made the film's title and theme a favorite with bloggers and on Internet fan sites all over the world. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "rating": "R (for language, a scene of sexuality and drug use, and intense sequences of terror and violence)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=10", "text": "Horror"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=13", "text": "Mystery & Suspense"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/david_r_ellis", "text": "David R.

Raised by kindly park ranger Beth (Debra Messing) since he was a just a cub, 900-pound grizzly Boog (Martin Lawrence) is content to spend his days entertaining Timberline tourists and his nights nestled safely in Beth's luxurious garage. Boog's life is about to get much more complicated, however, when paranoid hunter Shaw (Gary Sinese) returns from a recent foray in the woods with a frightened, one-horn mule deer named Elliot strapped trophy-like to the hood of his truck. Though at first reluctant to answer Elliot's desperate cries for help, gentle giant Boog eventually frees the thankful creature, who in turn decides to teach his hulking friend what it truly means to be free. Subsequently tranquilized and relocated into the wilderness after momentarily reverting to his true animalistic nature, Boog is forced to team with seasoned forest-dweller Elliot in order to find their way out of the woods before hunting season starts and Shaw comes gunning for all creatures great and small. Things are different in the woods than they were back in the safe confines of park ranger Beth's garage, though, and in order to find their way back to Timberline, Boog and Elliot are going to have to rely on the kindness of their fellow creatures, a rowdy and unruly bunch that includes an army of Scottish squirrels led by rogue critter McSquizzy (Billy Connolly), and a productive beaver construction team whose foreman, Reilly (Jon Faverau), is more than willing to lend a helping tail. With hunting season now upon them and time running out as the hunters close in, the unlikely duo of bear and mule deer put their new life lessons to good use by turning the tables on the gun-toting gamesmen, and once again making the woods safe for the furry critters who call the forest home. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "rating": "PG (for some rude humor, mild action and brief language)", "genres": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=1", "text": "Action & Adventure"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=2", "text": "Animation"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/browse/opening/?genres=6", "text": "Comedy"}], "directors": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/roger_allers", "text": "Roger Allers"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jill-culton", "text": "Jill Culton"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/anthony-stacchi", "text": "Anthony Stacchi"}], "writers": [{"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/steve_bencich", "text": "Steve Bencich"}, {"link": "https://rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ron_j_friedman", "text": "Ron J.

When Costigan is assigned the task of working his way into Costello's tightly guarded inner circle, Sullivan is faced with the responsibility of rooting out the informer before things get out of hand. With the stakes constantly rising and time quickly running out for the undercover cop and his criminal counterpart, each man must work feverishly to reveal his counterpart before his identity is exposed by the other.
